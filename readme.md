## Data Incubator Capstone Project Proposal - Service of the appropriate price for used-car.

The price of used-car is multifarious due to the status of the car. However, customers don't have enough information to make a decision. So they always depend on the dealer. On the other hand, dealers are suffered from pricing, too. They price used-car using their own or their team's tacit knowledge because they don't have clear criteria to decide the price.
In the real world, there are not only lots of trade data but also information about cars. Therefore I consider that the appropriate pricing of used-car is available if we can use the information on the status of the used-car such as color, transmission type, and odometer.
In data, I can recognize the price difference among used-cars on the same model.
[Graph 1 (Price difference by odometer per year)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8471958/68105887-39ca2c80-ff23-11e9-9362-a83e3a0e086f.png)
[Graph 2 (Price difference by color on the same model)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8471958/68105891-3c2c8680-ff23-11e9-9f87-6755894da170.png)
These two samples show the price is different by car statuses like odometer per year or painted color. The p-values are below 0.05, so the difference between groups(odometer or color) is accepted as significant.
I will predict the appropriate price for used-car using several features through this capstone project. Using the output of the project, customers can check the appropriate price of the used-car that they want to buy and spend their money efficiently. Dealers avoid the suffers from pricing with getting appropriate prices and reliable criteria. Also, dealers can decide to repair their used-car for increasing the selling price with the right repairs.
I have a plan to implement the following features.
Gathering Data.
Analysis of used-car trade data and Making a predictive model for pricing.
For customers, implement the web-page(or mobile application) to search the price and available used-car.
For dealers, show the predictive price difference due to each repair using the interactive user interface.
For individual sellers, recommend repairs to increase the predictive price.
